â Chat Bot using AWS LEX and Tensor flow  Python
The goal of project creates a chat bot for an academic institution or university to handle queries related courses offered by that institute. The objective of this task is to reduce human efforts as well as reduce man made errors. Even by this companies handle their client 24x7. In this case companies are academic institutions and clients are participants or students.
â Web scraping using Selenium web driver   Python
The task is to scrap the data from the online messaging portal in a text format and have to find the pattern form it.
â Data Visualization and Data insights   Hadoop Eco System, Hive, PySpark, QlikSense
The goal of this project is to build a Business Solutions to a Internet Service Provider Company, like handling data which is generated per day basis, for that we have to visualize that data and find the usage pattern form it and have a generate a reports.

This project is highly emphasis on tweets from Twitter data were taken for mobile networks service provider to do a sentiment analysis and analyze whether the expressed opinion was positive, negative or neutral, capture the emotions of the tweets and comparative analysis.

Quantifiable Results:
â Mentored 7-12 Data Science Enthusiast each year that have all since gone on to graduate school in Data Science and Business Analytics.
â Reviewed and evaluated 20-40 Research Papers on Data Science for one of the largest Data Science Conference called Data Science Congress by Aegis School of Business Mumbai.
